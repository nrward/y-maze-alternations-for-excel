##Y Maze Alternation Calculator for Excel Data

**Overview**

This is designed to calculate alternation data for Y maze test. This Perl script extracts data from a specified excel file, calculates all alternation data, and exports all data to a new excel file.

**Specifics**

The program prompts the user to input an excel file which contains arm visit data.  This data is collected by conducting a rodent Y maze test.  The user is asked a few questions regarding the location of certain data -- specifically the cell ranges and columns.  

The following data is calculated:
- total number of arm visits
- total possible alternations
- actual alternations
- percent alternations

When the data is done processing, the user is prompted to specify a new filename for the output excel file. This file is saved to the same location as the .pl file.
